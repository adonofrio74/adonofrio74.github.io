<h1>Three Website Opinion Article<h1>
	<p>I am going to be talking about why I like two great websites and why I don't like a not-so great website</p>
	
<h2><a href="http://www.espn.com/">ESPN</a></h2>
<p>I specifically like that ESPN has so much information on it's site. You can find so many different sports and teams. You can players and statistics. You can also play fantasy sports on this site. You can even watch live sports 
through WatchESPN. I like that it caters to all different types of fans no matter what sport. ESPN's coding is also modern. It uses tables for example when they list the box-scores from NBA games. I think that their layout
is very easy to understand and navigate. The have a scrolling effect that lets you view tons of the latest information in the sports world. I believe that you can navigate fairly well on this website. At the top of the page 
you can select what specific sport you want for example when you pick NFL a drop screen pops down with all the teams in the league which you can click on and it goes to a page all about that specific team. It also has other options 
like scores, free agency news, standings, etc. When you hover over the options it lights up red with white lettering. I also like that they have little pictures and logos next to the categories. ESPN uses a lot of red, white, and black for their main colors. I believe that picked colors that are
very "sporty" colors or in other words colors that are very popular for uniforms in the different sports leagues. The colors they use are very effective; I believe that they catch the attention of the user very well. They use white background color very well. It is simple but it gets the job done. They curve the edges of the 
photos and videos. Their text is very clean looking and is very easy to see. Overall I think that ESPN is a classic website that is widely used and is very popular across the world. I believe that many people rely on this site
for scores and news and much more. </p>

<h2><a href="https://fbgbgtraining.com/">FBGBG Training</a></h2>
<p>This is my trainer's business that I use to train for the football season when I'm back home. I personally really like the colors on his website. I don't really like that his website is so simple.  I like that it is so dark and then in the middle of the page is a big
white logo.This really captures the attention of the visitor to the site. I believe that he did this so that the logo will be engraved into the persons brain so that they remember his brand and hopefully give him business.
He could however use more colors help the website become less boring. He could make the category light up when you hover over the option. This could add some extra pizzazz. I also don't think that he 
used any categories on this website. I do believe that he did use HTML5 elements however it looks very basic. You can navigate around it pretty well but there isn't much there to navigate. There is also a trainers page that 
isn't built yet and just says that "trainers page under construction". There is no borders around the titles on the pages which I think could make it look more professional. It is also confusing why it goes to a different website
when you click on the category of "perform better equipment", I personally find this pretty annoying. The main colors on this website are black and white. Overall I think that he used the colors efficiently the black background and white lettering, 
though basic,is a classic/clean look. I believe that the things that negatively set it apart is just the simple and boringness of it. He could of made the images especially on the home page stand out 
more, instead of it just looking like you just pasted it on there like a word document. The biggest reason I don't like this website is the fact that it looks like something I could do "which is not a compliment". </p>

<h3><a href="https://www.southwest.com/">Southwest Airlines</a></h3>
 <p>I really like Southwest's website because I find that is very easy to use. I also like the colorfulness of the site. This colorfulness is the thing that sets it apart from other airline websites in my opinion. The blue 
 lettering they use looks very good on the website. They use the blue color that is the same color as their planes, this is a very good strategy. The main colors they use are blue, red. and yellow. There is a scrolling effect 
 and it is a good layout in my opinion. The layout is with the book the flight finder is right in the middle of the main page. They did this in my opinion so that customers can just search southwest.com and go right to the place 
where they can book a flight and chose their destination of choice without any extra clicking and searching for the page where it is. This layout is very straight to the point because really what else are you going to an airline's
website other than to book a flight. It is very easy to navigate. There is some tables at the bottom of the home page that talk about things like about southwest, their products and etc. The color they use is very effective because
the red, blue, and yellow look good together and look good with the white space they use. They also have a good use of graphics on the site. They use modern HTML elements on their site. They have categories you can click on that 
lead you to another page and light up when you hover over it with your mouse. Overall I think that it is a very professional and well-put together website.
