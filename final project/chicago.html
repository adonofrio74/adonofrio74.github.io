			<h1>Chicago</h1>
			<p>I grew up going to Chicago to visit my family when I was a kid, it holds a sort of nostalgia in my heart associated with fun times being with family. The city itself has so much to do as well. 
				Downtown Chicago has a lot of cool attractions and places you must visit while in the windy city. There is the aquarium, museum, Millennium Park, Navy Pier, and so much more. I also like to go see
					a Chicago White Sox game or Bears game. There is also so much great food in Chicago. The classic deepdish pizza is really good but there is also another kind of pizza in the city, it's a thin pizza
					thats is cut into little squares. I personally love this kind of pizza. My go to is a pepperoni and sausage from this place Papa Passero's in Westmont. You also have to try an italian beef sandwich with 
					giardiniera on top.</p>
